The report contains all sections (table of contents included).
Part 1 and 2 are written in the report. 
Screenshots of the Lo-fidelity prototype (Part 3a) and Hi-fidelity prototype (Part 3b) are contained in the report as well.

The high-fidelity prototype is the zip folder called 'Hi-Fi Prototype'.
To access it, open the 'index.html' file using an internet browser (Google Chrome preferred) and you will be directed to the home screen.

From the home screen, all buttons/navigation bars are functional and will lead you to the appropriate screen.
However, on other screens the buttons/navigation bars are not functional yet as this Deliverable is a mockup.
To go back to the home screen press back on your browser.
